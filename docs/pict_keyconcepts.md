# Key Concepts

Designed as a suite of tools as opposed to an opinionated framework, you can blend pict in with other types of tooling without damaging performance.  The key concepts for pict include:

1. State Management
1. Templating
1. Application Lifecycle Management
1. View Lifecycle Management
1. Provider Lifecycle Management
1. Mathematical and Other Types of Solving
1. Renderables and Rendering

Each of these come together to form a giant cat with ... alas, no.  But you can have configuration-only applications or highly customized workflows and flexibly switch between the two without having to rewrite your code.  And because of how state management works, you can easily reuse or migrate different components (templates, views, providers, etc.) around without rewriting all your code.
